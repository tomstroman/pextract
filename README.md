# pextract - PhysicsEducation eXtract

This is a one-time use tool to scrape HTML from an existing website so I can
populate a database that powers its replacement.

I am developing this with assistance from ChatGPT.

Initial setup:
```
cd $PEXTRACT # ~/code/pextract on the system where I'm running this
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
